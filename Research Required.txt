Areas Requiring Further Investigation in Optimation:

1. Theoretical Foundations

   - Formal definition and axiomatization of optimation versus classical optimization.
   - Mathematical modeling of variable weighting systems, especially under dynamic constraints.
   - Exploration of non-linear systems and emergent behaviors under incremental weighting schemes.
   - Links to fuzzy logic, heuristic methods, and decision theory.

2. Computational Methods

   - Algorithm design for granular techniques: half-adding, quarter-adding, exponential weighting.
   - Efficiency and convergence analysis for iterative adjustment algorithms.
   - Robustness of optimation under incomplete or noisy data.
   - Hybrid computational models combining optimation with AI/ML for adaptive tuning.

3. Application Domains

   - Real-world system testing in:
   
     * Business: dynamic strategy adjustment, portfolio balancing, supply chain weighting.
     * Engineering: multi-criteria design trade-offs, control system tuning.
     * Quantum computing: adaptive parameter setting in quantum circuits.
     * Public policy: balancing trade-offs in resource allocation with evolving goals.

4. Empirical Validation

   - Designing iterative experiments to compare optimation with classical optimization.
   - Metrics for evaluating effectiveness: stability, adaptability, stakeholder satisfaction.
   - Simulation environments with evolving constraints to model real-world complexity.
   - Longitudinal studies of decision-making systems using optimation principles.

5. Human-Centered or Decision-Making Contexts

   - Integration of subjective values and qualitative factors into weighting systems.
   - Visualization tools for exploring trade-offs and feedback in real-time.
   - Behavioral experiments on how users interact with optimation tools.
   - Multi-agent decision frameworks with adjustable, negotiable priorities.

These research areas offer a roadmap for turning optimation into a rigorous, versatile, and empirically grounded methodology, especially for complex, dynamic systems.
